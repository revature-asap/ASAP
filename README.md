# Asset Sentiment Analysis Platform (ASAP)

## Project Description

The Asset Sentiment Analysis Platform, or ASAP, is an application designed to allow users the ability to track and follow various financial assets (stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.). Assets can be added to a user's watchlist, which will allow for them to receive news and price updates on their dashboard. Additionally, users are able to perform online sentiment analysis on a chosen asset that will query social media APIS (such as Reddit and Twitter) for mentions of an asset or its symbol. The content of online posts about the asset can be given a bullish, bearish, or neutral rating based upon the analyzed sentiment, which is performed by AWS Comprehend. This will allow for users to be able to stay on top of retail investor sentiment for their favorite assets to aid them in anticipating market moves.

## Getting Started

First clone the repo to your local machine

- git clone https://github.com/revature-asap/ASAP.git

After the repo is cloned, you will need to have the following environment variables on your machine with corresponding values to your accounts across the sites leveraged

- db_url : the url of the database you are connecting to
- db_username : the username used to log into the database you are connecting to
- db_password : the password used for logging into the database you are connecting to
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID : the access key for AWS Comprehend
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY : the secret access key for AWS Comprehend
- email_username : the username of the email used for sending confirmation emails to newly registered users
- email_password : the password to the email used for sending confirmation emails to newly registered users
- reddit_public : the public key for hitting the Reddit API
- reddit_private : the private key for hitting the Reddit API
- reddit_username : the username for the reddit account used for accessing the Reddit API
- reddit_password : the password for the reddit account used for accessing the Reddit API
- twitter_bearer_token : the Twitter API token

You will need to install docker to your machine and have it running in order to create the docker image. The following docker command is run in the root package where the dockerfile is:

docker build -t asap:test . \
--build-arg DB_URL=$db_url \
--build-arg DB_USERNAME=$db_username \
--build-arg DB_PASSWORD=$db_password \
--build-arg AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
--build-arg AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
--build-arg EMAIL_USERNAME=$email_username \
--build-arg EMAIL_PASSWORD=$email_password \
--build-arg REDDIT_PUBLIC=$reddit_public \
--build-arg REDDIT_PRIVATE=$reddit_private \
--build-arg REDDIT_USERNAME=$reddit_username \
--build-arg REDDIT_PASSWORD=$reddit_password \
--build-arg TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=$twitter_bearer_token

Once the docker image has been built, you can run the docker image to have the project running locally on your machine with the following command

- docker run -d asap:test

In order to find the IP address that the program is running on your machine with, run the follwoing command

- docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' <name of Docker app>

Go to the ip address printed at port 5000 to see the application running

## Usage

> Here, you instruct other people on how to use your project after theyâ€™ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.
