# Asset Sentiment Analysis Platform (ASAP)

## Project Description

The Asset Sentiment Analysis Platform, or ASAP, is an application designed to allow users the ability to track and follow various financial assets (stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.). Assets can be added to a user's watchlist, which will allow for them to receive news and price updates on their dashboard. Additionally, users are able to perform online sentiment analysis on a chosen asset that will query social media APIS (such as Reddit and Twitter) for mentions of an asset or its symbol. The content of online posts about the asset can be given a bullish, bearish, or neutral rating based upon the analyzed sentiment, which is performed by AWS Comprehend. This will allow for users to be able to stay on top of retail investor sentiment for their favorite assets to aid them in anticipating market moves.
